    <h3>Clarification of Terms</h3>
    <h4 id="scale">Scale</h4>
    <p>The scale choice is crucial in determining how effective the choropleth is. Based on the nature of your dataset, you will want to choose one of the following to make the map more meaningful.</p>
    <h5><strong>Quantized</strong></h5>
    <p>This is a variant of a linear scale. Instead of a continuous domain, like a linear scale, the input domain is divided equally into the number of specified classes. Eventually, each class is differentiated by a specific color in the choropleth. This scale is available for any dataset.</p>
    <h5><strong>Logarithmic</strong></h5>
    <p>A nonlinear scale based on the orders of magnitude unlike a standard linear scale. This scale can be useful when dataset values grow exponentially. Because the logarithmic scale output approaches inifinity as the input approaches 0, this scale is only available to datasets where the values are exclusively negative, or exclusively positive.</p>

    <h4 id="scheme">Scheme</h4>
    <p>The schemes used in this app, are the same schemes that Cynthia Brewer used to develop and explain the ColorBrewer palettes, which are also used in this app.</p>
    <h5 id="sequential"><strong>Sequential</strong></h5> 
    <p>This scheme represents a collection of palettes that that appear to increase in magnitude. Here is how Cynthia Brewer describes it.</p>
    <blockquote class="help-quote">"The most basic guidance is to use lightness to represent ordered data. Ordered data can be ordinal (ranked) data or the more sophisticated interval or ratio scales of numerical data. Generally, darker colors are used to represent higher data values; light-to-dark for low-to-high. For example, a graphic showing pollution levels would usually show high levels in a dark color and progress through to lighter colors as pollution levels decrease. I have termed this type of progression a sequential color scheme. You need not strictly follow the rule of higher-darker, especially when making graphics to compare variables. For example, it is easier to see the relationships between education and poverty if sequential schemes are organized so that both high education and low poverty are represented with dark colors. The crucial part of the guidance is to pair a monotonic sequence in the data with a lightness sequence."

    </blockquote>
    <h5 id="diverging"><strong>Diverging</strong></h5>
    <p>This is most suitable for a dataset that hovers back and forth over a median value. One example of a Diverging dataset is Rebublicans vs. Democrats,  where red represents Republicans, blue represents Democrats, and white represents Independents. Here is Brewer's description:</p>
    <blockquote class="help-quote">"Variable comparisons can be accomplished with multiple graphics or can be facilitated by mapping differences within a single graphic. Again, careful use of hue and lightness can make this type of analytical graphic quite successful. For example, industrial pollution could be examined by symbolizing increases and decreases in acid rain over a given time period. These data are double-ended and they also have a crucial midpoint in the data range where, in this case, there has been no change in acid-rain levels. A diverging color scheme that emphasizes the meaningful midpoint in the data with a light color and then diverges to two different hues works well for this type of graphic. An example scheme would present high increases in dark red, moderate increases in medium red, low increases in light red, negligible change in white, low decreases in light blue, moderate decreases in medium blue, high decreases in dark blue. Emphasizing the two extremes with darker colors and emphasizing the midpoint with the lightest color clearly parallels the structure of the data. In addition to representing ‘no change or difference,’ a suitable midpoint that might be emphasized in the data range is the mean, median, zero, or other threshold value."

    </blockquote>
    <h5 id="qualitative"><strong>Qualitative</strong></h5>
    <p>This scheme is best for representing categories, such as religious affiliations. Each category is represented by a different color, but not in a way that assumes magnitude. Brewer explains further ...</p>
        <blockquote class="help-quote">"Categorical differences in data are usually represented with differences in hue. For example, types of government spending, such as military, education, and healthcare, are categories that could be shown with hues like red, green, and blue. Cartographers have termed this a qualitative color scheme. Pay attention to the lightness and saturation of the hues you choose for a qualitative scheme. If each category is equally important, you will want each to be fairly similar in its contrast with the background and with each other. For example, a pure yellow will not be as visible on a white background as red, green, or blue. Binary schemes are a special case of qualitative schemes for which either a lightness or hue difference (or both) is appropriate for the two categories."

    <h4>Palette</h4>
    <p>A palette, in the context of this application, is a collection of colors that was intentially assembled to communicate the scheme. This application uses the palettes that Cynthia Brewer has created specifically designed for maps. See <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">ColorBrewer</a> for more information.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <p>For choropleths that employ the Quantized scale, the number of classes determines the number of groups that your dataset is broken into, thus how many colors will be represented. The number of classes available is determined by the palette. Each palette includes at least 3 and as many as 12 classes.</p>
